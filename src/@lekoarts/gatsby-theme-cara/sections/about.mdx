# About Section

I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for coding and exploring all things techy. When I'm not immersed in software development, I enjoy engaging in activities that help me relax and recharge.

Indoor rock climbing is my go-to activity, where I challenge myself both physically and mentally while conquering various climbing routes. It's a thrilling experience that keeps me energized and motivated.

In addition to climbing, I find balance and inner calm through practising yoga. The meditative aspects of yoga allow me to rejuvenate and find clarity in a busy world.

During my downtime, I love watching movies, playing games, and savouring good moments with a refreshing beverage or a cup of coffee.

Sports-wise, I have a genuine interest in badminton, enjoying friendly matches that keep me active and engaged. And when I want to connect with nature and seek tranquillity, stand-up paddleboarding (SUP) provides the perfect escape on calm waters.

By embracing this blend of technology, indoor rock climbing, leisure activities, and sports, I strive to maintain a well-rounded lifestyle that fuels my creativity and overall well-being.
