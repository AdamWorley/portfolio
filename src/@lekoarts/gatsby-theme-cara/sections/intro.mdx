# Hi, I'm Adam Worley

I'm a seasoned software developer with over a decade of experience. My primary expertise lies in C#, but I have also delved into infrastructure development using Terraform, Container orchestrators and GO tooling, as well as exploring various front-end frameworks.

Currently, I am proud to be a part of the team at [netwealth](https://www.netwealth.com), a leading fintech company specializing in pensions and investments utilising the hybrid of digital tools and professional advisers. At netwealth, I contribute my skills and knowledge to develop innovative solutions and enhance the user experience.

With a strong passion for technology and a dedication to delivering high-quality software, I continuously strive to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
